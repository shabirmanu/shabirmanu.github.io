				<p>Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I’m Shabir Ahmad, a passionate researcher and innovator dedicated to exploring the intersection of AI, IoT, and large language models. Currently a non-tenure research professor at Gachon University, I have been fortunate to lead cutting-edge projects funded by the National Research Foundation.</p>

				<p>With a background in both industry programming and academic research, I’ve had the privilege of working on a range of exciting projects that push the boundaries of technology. My focus now is on optimizing large language models and developing solutions that address global challenges such as energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.</p>

				<p>As a permanent resident of Korea and soon-to-be Korean citizen, I am deeply connected to my new home and its vibrant tech community. I am always eager to explore new opportunities for collaboration and innovation. If you share my passion for advancing technology and solving complex problems, let’s connect and make a difference together.</p>
